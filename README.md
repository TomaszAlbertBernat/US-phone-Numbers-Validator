# US Telephone Number Validator

## Overview
This project is a simple yet effective US telephone number validator. It was created as part of my training on FreeCodeCamp. The application takes a user input and validates it against the standard format of US telephone numbers.

## Features
- Validates US telephone numbers in real-time.
- Provides instant feedback on the validity of the entered number.
- Allows users to clear the results and start over.

## How It Works
The application uses a regular expression to match the user's input against the standard format of US telephone numbers. If the input matches the pattern, it is considered a valid US telephone number. Otherwise, it is considered invalid.

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript

## How to Use
1. Enter a US telephone number in the input field.
2. Click the 'Check' button or press 'Enter' to validate the number.
3. The result will be displayed below the input field.
4. Click the 'Clear' button to clear the results and start over.
